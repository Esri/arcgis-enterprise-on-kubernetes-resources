# Dashboard Templates

With the removal of Grafana as part of the core product at 11.2, the dashboard templates that were previously included at instead hosted here for use with an organization-managed instance. For more information on how to use these templates, see the documentation to [view statistics](https://enterprise-k8s.arcgis.com/en/latest/administer/view-statistics.htm).

These templates were created and tested using Grafana release v12.3.1.

Older or newer versions may require changes to the dashboards, refer to the Grafana [release documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/) for potential breaking changes.

If any problems are found with the templates, please [provide feedback via an issue](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-enterprise-on-kubernetes-resources/issues/new/choose) and an accompanying pull request if available.
