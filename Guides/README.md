# Deployment guides

Markdown documents outlining the recommended setup steps for Amazon EKS and Azure Kubernetes Service clusters. The steps included within will configure a public-facing Kubernetes control plane instance and single node group with six nodes in a single availability zone. If desiring to run ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes in multiple availability zones, please see [multi-availability zone Kubernetes cluster administration](https://enterprise-k8s.arcgis.com/en/latest/administer/multi-availability-zone-kubernetes-cluster-administration.htm).
